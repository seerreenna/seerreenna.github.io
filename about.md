I began my data science journey in 2019 when I was first introduced to R during my statistics lecture. My curiosity was sparked and soon I began self-teaching R. Soon after, I taught myself Python. That was just the start.
<div></div>
<br> Today, I am well on my path into data science and, my curiosity still remains strong.
<div></div>
<br> I'm a quick learner with experience in many areas such as Statistical Analysis, Cloud Computing, ETL, Signal Processing, and Research.
